# British-Airways-Customer-Review-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modelling
This project is a part of the Data Science virtual internship program offered by Forage with British Airways.
# The virtual Internship is divided into two main tasks:
1. Web scraping to gain company insights
2. Predicting customer buying behaviour


# Task 1: Web scraping to gain company insights
Scrape and analyse customer review data to uncover findings for British Airways

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.
This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.

Customer review data for Britis Airways was collected from Skytrax.
The following insights were uncovered and summed up into one presentation slide.

# Task 2 - Predicting customer buying behaviour
Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. This is one of the reasons the buying cycle is very different to what it used to be. Today, if you’re hoping that a customer purchases your flights or holidays as they come into the airport, you’ve already lost! Being reactive in this situation is not ideal; airlines must be proactive in order to acquire customers before they embark on their holiday.

This is possible with the use of data and predictive models. The most important factor with a predictive model is the quality of the data you use to train the machine learning algorithms. For this task, you must manipulate and prepare the provided customer booking data so that you can build a high-quality predictive model.

With your predictive model, it is important to interpret the results in order to understand how “predictive” the data really was and whether we can feasibly use it to predict the target outcome (customers buying holidays). Therefore, you should evaluate the model's performance and output how each variable contributes to the predictive model's power.
The results were as follows:
